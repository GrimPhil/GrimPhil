# This is a personal account for tracking my progress in learning.
I want to be able to look back on my progress over time so I can see my improvements.
Because of that, I made this account on github and I want to keep track of what I am doing and how it is changing.

I am learning how to use git, github, and programming in general, so if anyone stumbles uppon this account by accident or something I made public and wants to leave some constructive criticism or advice, feel free to do so.
I am teaching myself everything that I am going to make.
